The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes; chose the data set: "All Earthquakes from the past 7 days.


Import & Visualize the Data
Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

Created a legend that will provide context for the map data.
